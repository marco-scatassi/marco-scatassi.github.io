    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>One of the main important tasks in the causal framework is the <strong><em>causal discovery task</em></strong>. The aim of this is to find the causal model underlines some given observational data.</p>
    <p>In particular, using the tool of the causal network, the discovery task became the task of identifying:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and</li>
    <li>a set of conditional probability distributions.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These two subtasks are referred as:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>structure learning</li>
    <li>parameter learning</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In order to justify the use of causal networks we have to assume that the underlying causal process follows a probability distribution. So, the underlying process can be represented by means of observational data sampled from the distribution.</p>
    <p>In this notebook, the focus will be on the activity of structure learning. Essentially, <strong><em>a partial implementation of the &quot;Algorithm 1 Greedy Search&quot; described in the paper [1] will be provided</em></strong>.</p>

    <p>This algorithm belongs to the class of the so-called <strong><em>score-based</em></strong> algorithm. This means that it follows a certain <strong><em>methodology to explore</em></strong> the space of possible DAG using a provided <strong><em>score function</em></strong> to evaluate candidate DAGs. </p>
