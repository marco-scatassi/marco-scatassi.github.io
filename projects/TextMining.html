        Reddit is a social news aggregation and discussion website where users post content (such as links, text posts, images, and videos) 
        on a wide range of topics in domain-specific boards called ”communities” or ”subreddits.” The following project aims to implement <b>text summarization</b> 
        and <b>topic modelling</b> pipelines on the textual content of Redditors' posts. The dataset used to achieve these goals is the <b>Reddit-based TL;DR</b> 
        summarization dataset TLDRHQ containing approximately 1.7 million Reddit posts (submissions as well as comments) obtained through scraping techniques. 
        Each instance in the dataset includes a Reddit post and its TL;DR, which is an acronym for ”Too Long; Didn't Read” and is an extremely short summary of the post's 
        content that is good practice for users to leave at the end of a post.

        While the Reddit usage has increased, the practice of write TL;DR didn't keep the pace. 
        In this context, a system (such as a bot) capable to automatically generate the TL;DR of a post could improve Reddit usability. 
        However, the <b>high abstractivity, heterogeneity</b> and <b>noisy</b> of posts make the text summarization task challenging. 
        In this work a <b>supervised extreme extractive summarization model</b> is developed. 
        Despite its lower complexity, results show that its performance are not so different with respect to the state of the art BertSumExt. 
        Moreover the <b>topic modeling analysis</b> of the posts could be really useful in identifying the hidden topics in a post and evaluate if it's 
        published in the right subreddit. In this project LSA and LDA techniques are used. 
        On this dataset LSA outperformed LDA and identified 20 well defined topics providing the respective document-topics and topic-terms matrices
