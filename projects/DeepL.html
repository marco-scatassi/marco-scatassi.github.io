    <p>
        Beeing able to identify specific class defects in product, such as wafermap, can help in understand what's wrong 
        in the production chain. So that it became possible to take necessary actions faster and in a targeted manner. 
        In this <a href="https://github.com/marco-scatassi/WM-811K-WaferMap-A-deep-learning-approach" target="_blank">repo</a>, 
        you can find the step followed, togheter with my colleagues 
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greta-gravina-742925189/">Greta Gravina</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/niccol%C3%B2-puccinelli-b1ba2a232/"> NiccolÃ² Puccinelli</a>, 
        in order to developed a simple CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), from the scratch, to face the problem previously descripted. 
        In particular, the problem consists in identify the type of defect of wafermaps among 9:
    <p>

    <p class="w3-center"> Center - Donut - Edge-Loc - Edge-Ring - Loc - Near-full - Random - Scratch - none </p>
    
    <p>
        Due to the extreme imbalance of the dataset, both among failure classes and between the non failure class (none) and the failure classes, 
        we have focused on the generation of synthetic data that together with classical augmentation techniques have lead in improve model performance. 
        In particular, the final model shows more uniform performance across classes than the initial one as well as a greater mean percentual of correct classified images.

    <p>Below, it's possible to play a little with one of the tested models in order to see how it works. I hope you will enjoy it! ðŸ˜„</p><br>
